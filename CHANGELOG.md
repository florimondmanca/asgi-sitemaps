## 0.3.0 - 2020-07-05

This release changes the approach from "scrape the ASGI app to gather URLs" to a programmatic class-based API inspired by Django's sitemap framework.

As such, the command line application does not exist anymore. Users are expected to define `Sitemap` classes, compose them into a `SitemapApp` endpoint, and add that to their ASGI app routing table.

See the new `README.md` documentation for more information.

### Changed

- Switch to a class-based dynamic endpoint API. (Pull #4)

## 0.2.0 - 2020-06-01

### Changed

- Project was renamed from `sitemaps` to `asgi-sitemaps` - sitemap generation for ASGI apps. (Pull #2)
- Change options of CLI and programmatic API to fit new "ASGI-only" project scope. (Pull #2)
- CLI now reads from stdin (for `--check` mode) and outputs sitemap to stdout. (Pull #2)

### Removed

- Drop support for crawling arbitrary remote servers. (Pull #2)

### Fixed

- Don't include non-200 or non-HTML URLs in sitemap. (Pull #2)

## 0.1.0 - 2020-05-31

### Added

- Initial implementation: CLI and programmatic async API.
